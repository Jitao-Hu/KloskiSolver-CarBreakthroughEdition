** use grid world vs use car class
use both probably
grid world is the base, uses array of cars for different games, and then insert to the grid world

** try to use A* to solve this problem

an array of cars, 
    for each car: 
        - if it is horizontal, it can be moved left or right
        - if it is vertical, it can be moved up or down
        this needs to be decided within the grid world
